                <p>Creativity has always been important to me. From a young age, I was always drawn to creative things. Whether that was music, design, film, I was always captivated by artistic expression. Fast forward a bit and I am now launching a career in web-development where I am matching my love for creativity with the attention to detail of technology.
                <br><br>
                After ten years of working in the restaurant industry as a chef, I began looking into a career change. I knew I wanted to work in technology, I had always loved working with computer growing up. I started looking into web-development and I was immediately hooked. I began studying as much as I could at night after work and started looking into what it would look like to jump into this industry.
                <br><br>
                A coffee meetup with a friend in the industry opened the door for an opportunity to interview for a position in his digital design agency as a Project Manager where I would work with design and development teams to lead projects. Two interviews later, I was offered the job and suddenly found myself diving head-first into a brand new industry that I had no previous experience in. While I was nervous, I was also excited to learn! For one year, I worked at that design agency with great people and work on some great projects
                <br><br>
                In the summer of 2017, I had to opportunity to enroll at CodeCraft School of Technology to pursue my goal of becoming a full stack web-developer, which you can read more about below. After graduating that 3 month program, I am now continuing to learn to develop these new skills while learning new technologies in an ever-growing industry.

                <br><br>
                CodeCraft School of Technology is located in Boulder, CO and I was apart of the 8th Graduating Class in September of 2017. I chose CodeCraft over other web-development boot camps for several reasons. I had done some work with CodeCraft in my past work as a project manager so I was familiar with the space and company. I also was drawn to the smaller classes, knowing I’d enjoy the experience more if I was able to get to know my classmates more. The 12 week intensive period was also appealing to me as a family man.
                <br><br>
                My experience at CodeCraft was a great one. Our instructor and teacher’s assistants really worked hard with us to help us through our studies. I would not have been nearly as successful in the program had I not had their support through the up’s and downs of the boot camp. I’m grateful to CodeCraft in helping me launch a career as a web-developer.
