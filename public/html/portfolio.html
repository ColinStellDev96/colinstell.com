                <p class="projectP">The Cigar Lounge App was my final project during my studies at CodeCraft School of Technology. Users are able to sign-up/login and use the application to keep track of the cigars they have enjoyed in two ways, total cigars enjoyed and
                    unique cigars enjoyed.<br><br> This single-page application was created using JavaScript, jQuery, Node.js, Express.js, Vue.js, and Mongoose along with Bootstrap to help with styling. I created my own database of 140 cigars for the
                    MVP (Minimum Viable Product) using a JSON data format. Future goals would be to continue to develop it further and release it as a mobile app.

                <p class="projectP">This simple Asteroid APP uses the NASA API to display data about "Near Earth Asteroids" on any selected date using JSON/AJAX. Users are able to select any past date from a date selector and the Asteroid data for name, velocity, distancefrom earth, and diameter appears in a styled table.

                <p class="projectP">During CodeCraft, we had a week-long Hackathon Project where we split up into three groups. We were tasked with building a full-stack application centered around health. Our group decided to build a simple web-application where a user would enter their desired calorie goal and gender. Within the app was a list of foods to eat and workouts to complete. We built our own database for each of these items. A progress bar tracks your calories as you click through foods eaten and workouts complete.<br>My role in this project was primarily front-end design. Stephany Prodromos and Kyle Estle were my two co-workers during this project.

I was also the primary copywriter for the project and was integral in the naming of the new brand. This was a re-branding project that included a new name, branding, and a new-website.

One of my main contributions to this project was working closely with the client to produce the copywrite for the web-site.
