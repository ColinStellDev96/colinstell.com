                <h2>The Cigar Lounge App</h2>
                <p>The Cigar Lounge App was my final project during my studies at CodeCraft School of Technology. Users are able to sign-up/login and use the application to keep track of the cigars they have enjoyed in two ways, total cigars enjoyed and
                    unique cigars enjoyed.<br><br> This single-page application was created using JavaScript, jQuery, Node.js, Express.js, Vue.js, and Mongoose along with Bootstrap to help with styling. I created my own database of 140 cigars for the
                    MVP (Minimum Viable Product) using a JSON data format. Future goals would be to continue to develop it further and release it as a mobile app.</p>

                <p>This simple Asteroid APP uses the NASA API to display data about "Near Earth Asteroids" on any selected date using JSON/AJAX. Users are able to select any past date from a date selector and the Asteroid data for name, velocity, distance
                    from earth, and diameter appears in a styled table.</p>
